							the south wing of the Palace are used by Household staff. The principal State Rooms

							Despite the Tower of London's grim reputation as a place of torture and death, within 
							these walls you will also discover the history of a royal palace, an armoury and a powerful fortress. 
							Don't miss Royal Beasts and learn about the wild and wonderous animals that have inhabited the Tower,
							making it the first London Zoo. Built in 1066 by William the Conqueror, the Tower of London is one of
							the world's most famous fortresses and an imposing landmark on the banks of the River Thames. 
							Nearly 1,000 years of history is contained within the walls, and centuries-old myths and traditions of
							the Tower still survive to this day. The Tower of London welcomes visitors all year round, so book your 
							ticket in advance and immerse yourself in London's rich history.

						<p> Other notable places include...</p>
						<br>
						<h3> The London Dungeons </h3>
						<p> The London Dungeon is a uniquely thrilling attraction that'll take you back 
						to the past's most horrible bits. See, hear, smell and feel London's darkest 
						stories as they come to life before your eyes. As you are taken back in time, you will come face-to-face
						with frighteningly funny characters, from torturers and judges to local legends. As you listen to their stories,
						you'll feel yourself drawn into another world, where the boundaries between reality and the past blur.
						Be warned: as you make your way through the London Dungeon, surprises are lurking in the darkness
						and will keep your senses on high alert as you anticipate what's waiting around the next corner...</p>
						
						<img src="img/London-dungeon.jpg">
						
						<br><br>
				
						<h3> The London Eye </h3>
						<p> The London Eye is centrally located in the heart of the capital, gracefully rotating
						over the River Thames opposite the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben. At 135 metres, the London
						Eye is the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel; a feat of design and engineering,
						it has become the modern symbol representing the capital and a global icon. The experience 
						showcases breathtaking 360-degree views of the capital and its famous landmarks and has been 
						the number one visitor experience in the city for the past decade. The gradual rotation in one of the
						32 high-tech glass capsules takes approximately 30 minutes and gives you an ever-changing perspective 
						of London. Within each capsule, interactive guides allow you to explore the capital's iconic landmarks
						in several languages.  An experience on the Coca-Cola London Eye will lift you high enough to see up 
						to 40 kilometres on a clear day and keep you close enough to see the spectacular details of the 
						city unfolding beneath you. </p>

						<br><br>
						
						<h3> St Paul's Cathedral </h3>
						<p> Enter St Paul's and enjoy the cathedral's awe-inspiring interior. Take advantage of a touch-screen 
						multimedia guide or join our guided tour to explore this iconic building, Venture down to the crypt and discover 
						the tombs and memorials of some of the nation's greatest heroes such as Admiral Lord Nelson and the 
						Duke of Wellington. Also visit Oculus, an award winning immersive film experience. Visitors can try out 
						the acoustic quirks of the Whispering Gallery and continue their climb to the Golden Gallery to enjoy
						breathtaking panoramic views across London. </p>
