						<h2 class="page-header">World War 2 and the conflicts in Great Britain</h2>
						<img src="img/WorldWar2.jpg" class="img-lg img-bordered blog-featured">
						<p>The Second World War (World War 2) lasted from 1939 to 1945. It was fought
						in Europe, in Russia, North Africa and in Asia. 60 million people died in World War 2.
						About 40 million were civilians. Children as well as adults were affected by the war. 
						The British government knew that Germany would target London in their bombing raids.
						If the capital was put out of action, it would severely affect the war effort and have 
						a devastating impact on the nation’s morale. The Blitz on London from September 1940 to
						May 1941 and the V1 flying bomb and V2 rocket attacks in 1944 caused a massive amount 
						of damage. It is estimated that  more than 12,000 metric tons of bombs were dropped on
						London and nearly 30,000 civilians were killed by enemy action. The worst hit places 
						tended to be the poorer districts, like the East End, but all Londoners were affected 
						by German air raids to a varying degree. </p>

						<h2 class="page-header">The Great Fire Of London</h2>
						<img src="img/FireOfLondon.jpg" class="img-lg img-bordered blog-featured">
						<p>A fire started on September 2nd 1666 in the King's bakery in Pudding Lane near London Bridge.
						 Fires were quite a common occurrence in those days and were soon quelled. Indeed, when the
						 Lord Mayor of London, Sir Thomas Bloodworth was woken up to be told about the fire, he replied "Pish! 
						 A woman might piss it out!". However that summer had been very hot and there had been no rain for 
						 weeks, so consequently the wooden houses and buildings were tinder dry. The fire soon took hold: 300
						 houses quickly collapsed and the strong east wind spread the flames further, jumping from house to house. 
						 The fire swept through the warren of streets lined with houses, the upper stories of which almost touched 
						 across the narrow winding lanes. Efforts to bring the fire under control by using buckets quickly failed.
						 Panic began to spread through the city. As the fire raged on, people tried to leave the city and poured
						 down to the River Thames in an attempt to escape by boat. </p>

						<br><br>
						1908 Olympics: The 1908 Olympic Games were scheduled to take place in Rome, but the eruption of Mount Vesuvius on

						1948 Olympics: The 1948 Olympics was the first to be held after World War II, after the 1944 Games was cancelled

						<h2 class="page-header">The infamous Jack The Ripper murders!</h2>
						<img src="img/JackTheRipper.jpg" class="img-lg img-bordered blog-featured">
						<p>Known for committing gruesome murders from August 7 to September 10 in 1888, "Jack the Ripper" a moniker 
						for the notorious serial killer, who was never identified, remains one of England's, and the world's, most infamous
						criminals. The culprit responsible for the murders of five prostitutes which all took place within a mile of each other, 
						and involved the districts of Whitechapel, Spitalfields, Aldgate and the City of London in London's East End in the autumn
						of 1888 was never apprehended. Despite countless investigations claiming definitive evidence of the brutal killer's 
						identity, his name and motive are still unknown. The moniker "Jack the Ripper" originates from a letter written by someone 
						who claimed to be the Whitechapel butcher, published at the time of the attacks. </p>

						<h2 class="page-header">London Transport and the unveiling of the British Underground</h2>
						<img src="img/LondonUnderground.jpg" class="img-lg img-bordered blog-featured">
						<p>London Underground's history dates back to 1863 when the world's first underground railway, the Metropolitan Railway, 
						opened between Paddington and Farringdon serving six intermediate stations. Since then the Underground network, affectionately
						nicknamed the Tube by generations of Londoners, has grown to 270 stations and 11 lines stretching deep into the Capital's suburbs, 
						and beyond. The development of London into the preeminent world city during the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries would not have 
						been possible without the mobility provided by the Underground. </p>

						<h2 class="page-header">The Black Death</h2>
						<img src="img/BlackDeath.jpg" class="img-sm img-bordered blog-featured">
						<p>The Black Death arrived in Europe by sea in October 1347 when 12 Genoese trading ships docked at the Sicilian port of
						Messina after a long journey through the Black Sea. The people who gathered on the docks to greet the ships were met with a 
						horrifying surprise: Most of the sailors aboard the ships were dead, and those who were still alive were gravely ill. They were 
						overcome with fever, unable to keep food down and delirious from pain. Strangest of all, they were covered in mysterious black 
						boils that oozed blood and pus and gave their illness its name: the “Black Death.” The Sicilian authorities hastily ordered the
						fleet of “death ships” out of the harbor, but it was too late: Over the next five years, the mysterious Black Death would kill more
						than 20 million people in Europe–almost one-third of the continent’s population.</p>

								<p>1. The Great Plague killed roughly a third of the entire population of Europe in the 15th Century,
								with London being particularly affected because of the narrow streets and lack of sanitation.</p>
								<br>
								<p>2. London was devastated by the Great Fire in 1666 and the Blitz during the height of the Second World War,
								with large parts of the city reduced to ruins.</p>
								<br>
								<p>3. The Millennium Dome is the biggest structure of its kind in the world, so big that it can fit the Great Pyramids
								of Giza comfortably under the roof!</p>
								<br>
								<p>4. 1.265 billion people use the London Underground every year. That’s slightly more than the population of India! 
								No wonder it’s so hard to get a seat!</p>
								<br>
								<p>5. London boasts over 170 museums, from the massive British museum, London’s most popular tourist attraction, to the 
								tiny Fan Museum in Greenwich; there is no excuse for having nothing to do on a rainy Saturday afternoon!</p>
								<br>
								<p>6. There are said to be 300 languages spoken in London, making it one of the most diverse cities in the world.</p>
								<br>
								<p>7. Big Ben, arguably London’s most famous landmark, is not called Big Ben at all. The tower is simply called The Clock 
								Tower; Big Ben is actually the name of the bell.</p>
								<br>
								<p>8. In a city filled with grand monuments and huge statues, it’s nice to know London has an official smallest statue. 
								Located on Philpot Lane, the statue of two tiny mice eating cheese is dedicated to two builders who fell during construction
								of The Monument after an argument over a missing sandwich, that they blamed on each other but ironically was actually the 
								fault of a mice infestation.</p>
								<br>
								<p>9. The identity of Jack the Ripper, London’s most notorious serial killer, has never been discovered.</p>
								<br>
								<p>10. When the London Underground was first proposed, engineers suggested filling the tunnels with water and using barges 
								to float people from station to station, or getting an army of horses to pull the carriages around in the dark.</p>

								<h3>Sir Winston Churchill</h3>
								<img src="img/Winston-churchill.jpg" class="img-sm">
								<p>As Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Sir Winston Churchill rallied the British people during WWII, and led his country 
								from the brink of defeat to victory. Born to an aristocratic family in 1874, Winston Churchill served in the British military 
								and worked as a writer before going into politics. After becoming prime minister in 1940, he helped lead a successful Allied 
								strategy with the U.S. and Soviet Union during WWII to defeat the Axis powers and craft post-war peace.</p>
								<br>
								<h3>Queen Victoria</h3>
								<img src="img/Queen-Victoria.jpg" class="img-sm">
								<p>Queen Victoria was queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 1837 to 1901—the second longest reign 
								of any other British monarch in history. To date, she is the the second longest reigning British monarch after Queen Elizabeth II. 
								Victoria's reign saw great cultural expansion; advances in industry, science, and communications; and the building of railways
								and the London Underground. She died in England in 1901.</p>
								<br>
								<h3>Queen Elizabeth II of England</h3>
								<img src="img/Queen-Elizabeth.jpg" class="img-sm">
								<p>The Queen has ruled for longer than any other Monarch in British history, becoming a much loved and respected figure across 
								the globe. Her extraordinary reign has seen her travel more widely than any other monarch, undertaking many historic overseas visits.
								Known for her sense of duty and her devotion to a life of service, she has been an important figurehead for the UK and the Commonwealth
								during times of enormous social change.</p>
								<br>
								<h3>Oliver Cromwell</h3>
								<img src="img/Oliver-Cromwell.jpg" class="img-sm">
								<p>Oliver Cromwell rose from the middle ranks of English society to be Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland, the only 
								non-royal ever to hold that position. He played a leading role in bringing Charles I to trial and to execution; he undertook the most
								complete and the most brutal military conquest ever undertaken by the English over their neighbours;</p>
								<br>
								<h3>King Henry the VIII</h3>
								<img src="img/King-Henry.jpg" class="img-sm">
								<p>Henry VIII is famous for having six wives two of whom he executed at the Tower of London. Henry VIII broke with the Roman Catholic 
								Church and established the Church of England – all to get his first divorce. This also allowed him to seize church land and property 
								(a great help in financing costly European wars). Under Henry VIII, England witnessed the wholesale destruction of beautiful monastic buildings 
								and libraries.</p>
								<br>
								<h3>Florence Nightingale</h3>
								<img src="img/Florence-Nightingale.jpg" class="img-sm">
								<p>On 4 November 1854, Florence Nightingale arrived in Turkey with a group of 38 nurses from England. Britain was at war with Russia (the Crimean War 1854-1856) 
								and the conditions in the hospitals were very bad. Hundreds of soldiers were injured in the fighting. In those days, hospitals were very basic 
								and the soldiers were not given good food and medicine to help them get better. Florence Nightingale realised that if the doctors were going to allow 
								her nurses to work then they had to do a very good job</p>
								<br>
								<h3>William Shakespeare</h3>
								<img src="img/Shakespeare.jpg" class="img-sm">
								<p>William Shakespeare, often called the English national poet, is widely considered the greatest dramatist of all time. 
								William Shakespeare was baptized on April 26, 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. From roughly 1594 onward he was an important member of 
								the Lord Chamberlain’s Men company of theatrical players. Written records give little indication of the way in which Shakespeare’s professional 
								life molded his artistry. All that can be deduced is that over the course of 20 years, Shakespeare wrote plays that capture the complete 
								range of human emotion and conflict.</p>
